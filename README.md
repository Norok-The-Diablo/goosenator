### WHAT IS "The Goosenator 6000"?

"The Goosenator 6000" is an application you load onto a USB drive that can configure and install Desktop Goose in many ways. It works on almost any modern Microsoft Windows operating system.


### WHAT IS "Desktop Goose"?

"Desktop Goose" is an application with the sole purpose of causing chaos. The goose will run around your screen stealing your mouse, tracking mud, writing notes, and bringing memes. He also honks, A LOT. Simulation of "Desktop Goose" honking. (Credit to House House for this honking noise.)

### INSTALLATION GUIDE: 

First, download the source code or release of your choice.
Second, extract the .zip file you just downloaded from this GitHub repository or my website.
Third, copy-paste the contents of the .zip on to a USB drive. Make sure the contents of the .zip are not in a folder on the USB drive.
NOTE: You MUST have "The Goosenator 6000" on a D: drive. It was programmed with the D: drive in mind and using any other letter for your USB will require modification of the code. ALSO NOTE: I am using a modified version of "Desktop Goose".

### SPECIAL THANKS:

All credit for "Desktop Goose" goes to https://samperson.itch.io/. Trailer for "Desktop Goose": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQx6fyrZDWM. The idea for both "Desktop Goose" and "The Goosenator 6000" came from "Untitled Goose Game", a video game about a goose wreaking havoc on a small town made by House House. The rest of the project was programmed by me, Toma Brasoveanu, a Romanian-American programmer.
