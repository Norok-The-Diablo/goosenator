### WHAT IS "The Goosenator 6000™"?

"The Goosenator 6000™" is an application you load onto a USB drive that can configure and install Desktop Goose in many ways. It works on almost any modern Microsoft Windows operating system.

### INSTALLATION GUIDE: 

First, download the source code or release of your choice.
Second, extract the .zip file you just downloaded from this GitHub repository.
Third, copy-paste the contents of the .zip on to a USB drive. Make sure the contents of the .zip are not in a folder on the USB drive.
NOTE: You MUST have "The Goosenator 6000™" on a D: drive. It was programmed with the D: drive in mind and using any other letter for your USB will require modification of the code.
Fourth, plug the newly-made USB into a computer and install the components you want by double-clicking the files with names of the functions you want. An example of a file you would double-click is "Install Desktop Goose.lnk".

### SPECIAL THANKS:

All credit for Desktop Goose goes to https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose. Trailer for Desktop Goose: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQx6fyrZDWM. The idea for both "Desktop Goose" and "The Goosenator 6000" came from "Untitled Goose Game" a video game about a goose made by House House. The rest of the project was programmed by me, Toma Brasoveanu, a Romanian-American programmer that lives in California.
